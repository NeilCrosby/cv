                                At the Plymouth Marine Laboratory I was required to
                                perform many varied tasks around the creation and
                                maintenance of satellite support software, as well as
                                redeveloping the

                    As the Front-End Architect for Search in Europe at Yahoo!, I
                    was responsible for leading a small team of engineers
                    who rebuilt the front-end component of the
                    SearchMonkey Developer Tool.  Key requirements
                    of the Developer Tool rebuild were to increase its
                    accessibility and usability.

                <p>
                    I was also responsible for overseeing the ongoing
                    development of the SearchMonkey Gallery.

                    Aimed at a "tech savvy" audience, The Yahoo! Answers Badge
                    Builder tool gave users the chance to create a javascript
                    badge to insert onto their own sites which showed off
                    Yahoo! Answers content.

                    This is my personal blog, where I write about technical
                    subjects.  By writing about such subjects as
                    <a href="http://thecodetrain.co.uk/tag/feci/">automated front-end testing</a>,
                    <a href="http://thecodetrain.co.uk/tag/pipes/">building data resources using Yahoo! pipes</a>
                    and

                    I solidify this knowledge in my own mind whilst also
                    help others who are investigating similar issues.

                    Because I have a presence on many different websites
                    across the internet, I wanted to have a single page where
                    the data I was creating could be pulled together. The goal
                    was to create a single page which could be used to give an
                    overview of the data that I was creating and the things
                    which are currently important to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data flow into the page is powered by Yahoo! Pipes,
                    which allows the data creation and display portions of the
                    page to be kept loosely coupled, as well as providing an
                    easy way to add new data sources to the page.
